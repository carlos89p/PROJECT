# Autonomous Driving System with AI

## Overview
This project focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence techniques into autonomous driving systems. The goal is to develop a modular framework that combines computer vision for real-time object detection, intelligent decision-making through deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) for user interaction.

## Features
- **Computer Vision:** Detects pedestrians, traffic lights, and other critical road elements using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and YOLO.
- **Machine Learning:** Implements deep learning models to improve real-time decision-making in dynamic environments.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Allows interaction with users through voice commands using speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Uses OpenCV and TensorFlow for video stream analysis and intelligent navigation.

## Objectives
- Develop an intelligent system that enhances autonomous driving capabilities.
- Implement a computer vision module for pedestrian and traffic signal detection.
- Utilize NLP to facilitate user interaction through voice commands.
- Train and fine-tune deep learning models for improved decision-making.
- Deploy and test the system in a simulation environment.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow & Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection**
- **Speech recognition and synthesis models**
