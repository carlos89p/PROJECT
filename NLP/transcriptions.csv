" Hello, my name is Romain and my favorite day of the week is Monday because from 8 to 9.50 we have PE, then we have a 15 minute break, then we have PE again from 10.00 5.00 to 11.00. It is so fun. After that from 11.00 to 11.55 we have music, then we have lunch from 11.55 to 1.10. After lunch from 1.10 to 2.5 we have French and to finish off the day we have Spanish. I also like Wednesdays because from 1.10 to 2.5 we have art that is one of my very favorite classes. I don't really like Tuesdays because there isn't any of my favorite classes and we have to start the day off with math. Thank you for listening. Bye!"
